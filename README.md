# 🌱 IoT-Enabled Smart Agriculture Monitoring System

## 📌 Project Overview

The IoT-Enabled Smart Agriculture Monitoring System is a smart farming solution designed to monitor environmental conditions in real time and automate irrigation decisions.

The system continuously tracks:

* Soil Moisture
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Light Intensity
* Water Level

Based on threshold values, the system generates alerts and controls irrigation systems automatically to reduce water wastage and improve crop productivity.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional farming relies heavily on manual monitoring of soil and environmental conditions. This often leads to:

* Excessive water consumption
* Delayed irrigation
* Crop stress
* Reduced productivity

This project solves these challenges using IoT-based monitoring and automation.
